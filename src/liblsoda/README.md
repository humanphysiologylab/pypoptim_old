# ORIGIN:
https://github.com/nlmixrdevelopment/liblsoda
This code was slightly modified to avoid collisions with Python's mkl library.


# liblsoda

This is a C library that implements the LSODA algorithm from Linda Petzold and Alan Hindmarsh, which solves the initial value problem for stiff or nonstiff systems of first order ordinary differential equations

```
dy/dt = f(t,y)
```

or, in component form,

```
dy(i)/dt = f(i) = f(i,t,y(1),y(2),...,y(neq)) (i = 1,...,neq).
```

## Building

This code has only been tested on Linux to date.

```
git clone http://github.com/sdwfrost/liblsoda
cd liblsoda
make
```

If you want to compile with OpenMP, using `CFLAGS=-fopenmp make` instead.

## Testing

```
cd test
make
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=../src:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
./test
```

This should give the following.

## Contributors

This code has a compllicated history; all I have done is to refactor the code so that it compiles cleanly, and generates a shared library.

- The original code by Petzold and Marsh was written in Fortran, then converted to C. It is available from [here](http://www.ccl.net/cca/software/SOURCES/C/kinetics2/index.shtml), and the code is mirrored in the `orig/lsoda-orig` subdirectory.
- Heng Li [@lh3](http://github.com/lh3) refactored the code, which is available [here](http://github.com/lh3/misc). The code is mirrored in the `orig/lsoda-lh3` subdirectory.
- Yu Feng [@rainwoodman](http://github.com/rainwoodman) refactored Heng Li's code to make it reentrant. The code is available [here](https://github.com/rainwoodman/psphray), and is mirrored in the `orig/lsoda-rainwoodman` subdirectory.
